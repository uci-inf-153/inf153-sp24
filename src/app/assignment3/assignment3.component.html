    <h1>Assignment 3: Practicing Content Moderation</h1>
    <h3>Due 11:59pm May 29, 2024</h3>
    <h2>Assignment Description</h2>
    <p>Being a moderator is hard work! <a href="https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/19318">Scholars have estimated</a> that Reddit moderators worked a minimum of 466 hours <em>each day</em> in 2020, providing value upwards of $3 Million annually for the platform in volunteer labor. Moreover, moderators often have to make tough and unpopular choices around what content is allowed, and when to ban or reinstate fellow community members. And finally, moderators are on the front lines, aiming to ensure that your typical user is not exposed to vulgar, harmful, or offensive content.</p>
    <p>In this assignment, you'll get a small gimpse into the work that a Reddit moderator. Beyond gaining deeper understanding and appreciation of the labor that goes into moderation, you will pick up a richer sense of how to design effective (or not-so-effective) rules for online governance.</p>
    <p>To practice content moderation, you will pick two Subreddits, read through, and compare the rules that govern those Subreddits. You will then look at some of the newest posts on those Subreddits, and make judgments about whether they follow the Subreddit's rules. And if not, what actions should be taken as a result.</p>
    <h3>Choosing two Subreddits</h3>
    <p>To complete this assignment, you must first choose <strong>two Subreddits</strong> to examine. Subreddits are diverse, ranging from massive and wide-ranging forums with millions of members to niche topics with only a few interested users. Moderation is perhaps most challenging somewhere in the middle: where a community has enough activity from enough people to need rules and governance, but not so large that the rules have been heavily scrutinized and automated. We therefore have a few requirements around what Subreddits you can choose.</p>
    <p>If you do not use Reddit often, an easy way to find Subreddits is through the platform's <a href="https://reddit.com/subreddits">search feature</a>. There are Subreddits for a wide range of topics, from DIY groups and sports to specific movies or TV shows!</p>
    <p>Your two chosen Subreddits must:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Have similar topics to one another. For example, both Subreddits could focus on politics, or on sports, or on a television show. Topics do not need to be identitical. You can compare Subreddits related to hockey and football, for example, or two different anime shows.</li>
        <li>Be large, but not too large. We think that Subreddits with between 50,000 and 3 Million members (roughly Top 1-3% of all Subreddits, but outside of the Top 100) are a good fit for this assignment. Treat this as rough guidance, e.g., Subreddits with 48k or 3.2 Million members are also fine.</li>
        <li>Have recent content. If you sort by new (more on that below), you should be able to grab 20 posts (or more) from within the past 24 hours. Similarly, treat this as rough guidance.</li>
        <li>Have a reasonable and applicable set of Rules which govern the Subreddit. We think a target community should have at least 6 Rules (more on where to find those below), with at least 2 being specific to the Subreddit's topic. For example, most Subreddits have some version of <em>"don't be mean"</em> and/or <em>"don't post illegal things"</em>. But UCI's Subreddit has specific Rules banning naming of TAs or students, and non-university promotions, which will be more interesting to reflect on later.</li>
        <li>Not center hurtful or inappropriate content. There's a judgment call here, of course, primarily remember that your course staff will look at the content you choose. Please do not select NSFW (Not Safe For Work) Subreddits, for example.</li>
        <li>Either center English-language content, or you provide the translation for each post. Image memes, videos, etc. are also fine, so long as accompanying text is in English or translated.</li>
        <li>Not be related to UCI, or any other school or university. Variety in Subreddits will lead to more interesting analysis and discussion. Find Subreddits related to your quirky hobby, less-mainstream pop culture interest, or something else entirely!</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Content Warning:</strong> By looking at the newest content of a Subreddit, there's a (hopefully small) chance that you might inadvertently be exposed to content that you might find hurtful or inappropriate. As we've <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/25/18229714/cognizant-facebook-content-moderator-interviews-trauma-working-conditions-arizona">read about</a>, this is what real moderators face as well. Give yourself some space and distance when doing this assignment, and do not hesitate to reach out to the course staff if you encounter anything which you would like to talk through.</p>
    <p>The following subsections of the assignment description use <a href="http://reddit.com/r/UCI">UCI's Subreddit</a> as an example. Please select two other Subreddits to complete the assignment, following the criteria above.</p>
    <h3>Template for Practicing Moderation</h3>
    <p>We have prepared a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pJU6RvFN8F84tdhGq4t4dsbYUgN7DlS6sx1OXYNq0eg/edit?usp=sharing">template in Google Docs</a> for describing the Rules of your Subreddits and practicing content moderation. You will need to make two copies of this template, one for each of your two Subreddits. You will also create a third file, written in whatever format you like, for your overall reflection.</p>
    <h3>Understanding the Rules</h3>
    <p>First, read through the Rules of the two Subreddits, and copy them into the templates (this is primarily for ease of grading). On Reddit, Rules are listed in the sidebar of the Subreddit; you may have to scroll for a bit to reach them. Make sure that you read and share the full description of the rules by expanding on the descriptions.</p>
    <p>Given the similar topics, there will likely be some overlap in the Rules of each Subreddit. After you get some practice with moderation, you will reflect on how the Rules differ, and the effectiveness of each set of Rules.</p>

    <h3>Practicing Moderation</h3>
    <p>With your selected Subreddits intact, and with your understanding of the Rules of each Subreddit, you will now take on the role of a moderator.</p>
    <p>For each of the two Subreddits, first sort by "new" posts. Depending on the Subreddit, posts may or may not have been already assessed by an <a href="https://www.reddit.com/wiki/automoderator">AutoModerator</a> (e.g., an algorithmic moderation tool). Looking at "new" posts also increases the likelihood that posts have not yet been manually reviewed by a human moderator, so your experience will be more in line with what typical moderators experience.</p>
    <p>Then, take a screenshot of each of the 20 most recent posts in each Subreddit. Please crop your screenshots; here are instructions for <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-11/how-to-take-screenshot-on-windows-10/m-p/3760249">Windows (Snipping Tool)</a> and <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/take-a-screenshot-mh26782/mac">Mac (Screenshot)</a>. We recommend that you do this in one sitting, to avoid getting duplicate posts.</p>
    <img src="assets/images/a3_new.png" alt="Screenshot of UCI's Subreddit, with an arrow pointing to the 'new' option in the sort options dropdown" width="50%">
    <p>For each screenshot, refer back to the Rules of the Subreddit and make a judgment about whether that post should be allowed, not allowed, or if it's a tough decision. Add a bit of rationale (can be a sentence or two). We expect that you may have more to say about posts which you think should not be allowed or are otherwise ambiguous. You will not be directly graded on whether we agree with your judgment, but rather on whether you have thought about how the content of the post relates to the Subreddit's Rules.</p>
    <p>You may want to start a timer prior to beginning your practice; you will be asked to reflect on how (roughly) long you spent making moderation decisions. We recognize that in practice, Subreddit moderators are likely make decisions rather quickly, both to manage the volume of content in their community and because they grow familiar with their community's Rules (and possibly helped create them). We expect that your decisions may take longer, as you familiarize yourself with the Rules and reflect on your decisions.</p>
    <p>For the purpose of this part of the exercise, try to be as rigid as you can in interpreting the Subreddit's Rules. You will later reflect on whether those Rules feel interpretable, sufficient, and appropriate.</p>
    <h3>Reflecting on Rules and Moderation</h3>
    <p>Now that you have gotten some experience being a moderator, you will reflect on the process and the Rules of the Subreddits you moderated for. Write up a reflection on your experiences.</p>
    <p>In your reflection, include (please use numbers and/or headings to differentiate these sections):</p>
    <ol>
        <li>A sentence or two stating the two Subreddits you picked, and the commonality in topic between them. This should be at the beginning of your writeup.</li>
        <li>A reflection on the process of moderation.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Which Subreddit was harder to make moderation decisions about, and why?</li>
            <li>We have discussed how norms can differ between communities, even around similar topics. What differences did you notice between the type of content, or how users introduce that content (e.g., post titles, descriptions), between the two Subreddits?</li>
            <li>We also discussed how members learn community norms from what content is allowed, and not allowed, on their platform. How do you think your moderation decisions would influence the norms of each Subreddit?</li>
            <li>Scholars <a href="https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/19318">Li et al.</a> estimate that in the U.S., similar moderation work to what you did in this assignment can pay $20/hour. About how much would you have been paid for your work? Does this feel like a lot, a little, or somewhere in between given how you found the task?</li>
            <li>In class, we discussed how moderators can perceive the act as rewarding, but also tedious and occasionally upsetting. How did you find the process of moderating posts?</li>
        </ul>
        <li>A comparison of the <em>Rules</em> of the two Subreddits.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>How were Rules similar between the two Subreddits? How were they different?</li>
            <li>Where the Rules differed, how did that influence how you approached moderation of specific posts? What Rules were easy to interpret and apply, and what were more challenging?</li>
            <li>Did you encounter instances where your interpretation of the Subreddit's Rules went against the moderation decision that you would have liked to make? For example, a post which you would have liked to remove, but the Rules indicated should be allowed?</li>
            <li>For each Subreddit, if you were to become the Subreddit's Benevolent Dictator, what Rules would you add, remove, or change? How would these changes to the Rules impact the work of moderators, or the kind of content which can appear in the Subreddit? Aim to be specific in what you would suggest to add, remove or change. For example, you could suggest new or alternative wording, and argue for why that might help improve decision-making.</li>
            <li>For each Subreddit, with sufficient resources, what Rules do you think could be potentially be automated (e.g., algorithmically decided)? What might be benefits to doing so? Challenges?</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
    <h2>Submission</h2>
    <p>You will submit a zipped folder with three files as part of this assignment. Submissions will be made to <a href="https://canvas.eee.uci.edu/courses/62680/assignments/1389567">Canvas</a>.</p>
    <h3>Submission format</h3>
    <p>Your zip should contain the following three files:</p>
    <ul>
       <li><code>subreddit_[name1].pdf</code>: moderation decisions for your first selected Subreddit, following the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pJU6RvFN8F84tdhGq4t4dsbYUgN7DlS6sx1OXYNq0eg/edit?usp=sharing">Google Docs template</a>. Naming should follow the Subreddit's name. For example, if your first Subreddit was <a href="http://reddit.com/r/UCI">UCI's Subreddit</a>, your file should be named <code>subreddit_UCI.pdf</code>.</li>
       <li><code>subreddit_[name2].pdf</code>: moderation decisions for your second selected Subreddit, following the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pJU6RvFN8F84tdhGq4t4dsbYUgN7DlS6sx1OXYNq0eg/edit?usp=sharing">Google Docs template</a> and the same naming convention.</li>
       <li><code>reflection.pdf</code>: a document reflecting on your experience interpreting the Rules and moderating your Subreddits, with sections described above. We expect it will take approximately 1,000 words to adequately answer these questions (4 pages, double spaced). You may find it helpful to include images or other figures; these may also result in a writeup that is longer in terms of number of pages.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Grading</h2>
    <p>Your grade will be broken down as follows, with description of what is required for the maximum score (mastery) in each category:</p>
    <ul>
       <li><strong>Practicing Moderation (4 points):</strong> Thoughtful moderation choices, and rationale which contextualizes those choices in light of the two Subreddit's Rules.</li>
       <li><strong>Reflecting on Moderation (5 points):</strong> Writeup considers the labor, logistically and emotionally, behind moderation, as well as reflects on differences in the norms of the two Subreddits.</li>
       <li><strong>Reflecting on Rules (5 points):</strong> Articulation of similarities and differences between the Subreddit's rules, and considerate suggestions for changes to make those Rules easier to apply or automate.</li>
       <li><strong>Format (1 point)</strong>: Assignment is in the correct format.</li>
    </ul>
