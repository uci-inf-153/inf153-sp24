      Policies and background for IN4MATX 153, Spring 2024 Quarter. 
      <span class="tbd">All syllabus content is subject to change, particularly prior to the start of the quarter.</span>
   </p>
   <h2>Course Description</h2>
   <p><strong>In late 2023, the Informatics department decided to modify the title, topic, and focus of this class.</strong> The <a href="http://catalogue.uci.edu/search/?P=IN4MATX%20153">catalog description</a> is therefore slated to be updated for next academic year (2024-2025). Rather than teaching the current catalog's material, the class this quarter will follow the new title and description appearing below.</p>
   <blockquote><strong>IN4MATX 153: Design of Social and Interpersonal Technologies.</strong> Considerations around the design of technologies beyond the individual. Topics may include social media, messaging and communication, feeds, algorithmic recommendations, privacy and access.</blockquote>
   <p></p>
   <p>This change was made to better reflect the modern technological landscape. Nearly all "work" today is computer-supported, and cooperative, leading to substantially less need to specifically interrogate what changes in these environments. However, the rise of social media has led to a need to more deeply examine how people communicate with one another, how that content gets aggregated and summarized, and how privacy and access are implicated by decisions made in this space. This class will interrogate these topics, and more.</p>
   <h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
   <p>At the end of this course, students should be able to:</p>
   <ul>
      <li>Relate social scientific and technological concepts to the design of social or interpersonal technology.</li>
      <li>Identify the potential social benefits offered by the design of a social or interpersonal technology.</li>
      <li>Critique the potential harms furthered by the design of a social or interpersonal technology.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Format</h2>
   <p>Delivery of course content will be <strong>synchronous, but classes will be recorded</strong>. In alignment with assessment of <a href="syllabus#participation">participation</a>, attendance at lecture is required for credit for participation.</p>
   <h3 id="electronics">Use of Electronics in Lecture</h3>
   <p>We encourage you to limit your use of other devices, apps, websites, etc. The evidence is clear: students <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177%2F0956797614524581">take worse notes</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/01443410.2018.1489046">perform worse on exams</a> when they use devices during lectures. We will do our best to ensure synchronous material delivery is worthwhile, and we hope students come to class excited to learn.</p>
   <h2>Communication</h2>
   <p>Course Staff Email: <a href="mailto:informatics-153-staff@uci.edu">informatics-153-staff@uci.edu</a>.</p>
   <p>When you do send an email, please send it to the course list rather than emailing Professor Epstein directly. Doing so will help ensure the message does not get lost and will help the entire course staff stay informed. We may defer answering some questions over email and will address them in the next class session.</p>
   <h2>Required Text and Videos</h2>
   <p>This class will have a number of required articles to read and videos to watch, assocaited with each class period. It is expected that you engage with this material <strong>before class</strong>.</p>
   <h2>Assessment</h2>
   <p>Grades will be calculated as follows:</p>
   <ul>
      <li>Assignments: 45%</li>
      <ul>
         <li>A1: Making a Meme (15%)</li>
         <li>A2: Analyzing Defunct Social Platforms (15%)</li>
         <li>A3: Practicing Content Moderation (15%)</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Online Reading/Video Engagement: 15%</li>
      <ul>
         <li>Potential for extra credit across the quarter for particularly thoughtful engagement (Up to 2.5%)</li>
      </ul>
      <li>In-Class Participation: 15%</li>
      <ul>
         <li>Potential for extra credit across the quarter for particularly thoughtful engagement (Up to 2.5%)</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Final Take-Home Exam/Essay: 25%</li>
      <li>Professional penalty: up to -100%. We expect students to be respectful to course staff and classmates, and unprofessionalism can be held against a student when calculating final grades. UCI's <a href="https://aisc.uci.edu/policies/pacaos/grounds-for-discipline.php">Grounds for Discipline</a> describes the types of cases where this penalty could be applied. This penalty will only be assessed in extreme cases; we will give a warning prior to any action.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>Areas may be curved to ensure grades align with student successes toward learning objectives. We expect any curve would be "up" rather than "down".</p>
   <p>Grades follow the <a href="https://www.reg.uci.edu/services/transcripts/notations.html">official UCI policies</a> (e.g., D- and above are passing grades).</p>
   <h3>Assignment Submission</h3>
   <p>All assignments and the Final Exam/Essay will be uploaded to Canvas for submission. Online Reading/Video Engagement will be on Perusall, with grades automatically transferred into Canvas.</p>
   <h3 id="duedates">Assignment Due Dates</h3>
   <p>Unless otherwise specified, all assignments are due "at the end of the day" on whatever date is listed on the calendar. In practice, we will implement this on Canvas as 11:59pm Pacific <strong>(note time zone)</strong> that day.</p>
   <p>In the case of online reading, all engagement will be due "at the end of the day" on the day <strong>before</strong> the class that the readings/videos are for. This will enable the course staff to read and reflect on student comments prior to class.</p>
   <h3>Late Assignments</h3>
   <p>Late assignments will be assessed a 10% penalty for each 24-hour period after the due date. Assignments more than two days late will not be accepted without advance permission.</p>
   <p><strong>The course staff is willing to grant extensions within reason when requested</strong>. We ask that you don't request extensions when they are not necessary, as assignments build on one another and delays can snowball.</p>
   <p>To request an extension, email the course staff at least 24 hours before the assignment due date. Late extension requests may be accommodated in exceptional circumstances, but shouldn't be expected. Include in your email when you now plan to submit the assignment. A typical extension would be for a few days, a week at most. To ensure that we can submit final grades on time, <strong>we will not grant extensions on the final essay/exam</strong>. We also reserve the right to refuse any extension (a second extension, for example). All <a href="syllabus#integrity">academic integrity</a> policies continue to apply to late submissions.</p>
   <h3>Exams</h3>
   <p>Given the emphasis on discussion and critique in this course, there will be a final exam or essay. The exact format of the final exam/essay is still subject to change. Expect it to be a take-home prompt (or a few prompts), due at the time of the final exam period.</p>
   <h3 id="participation">Participation</h3>
   <p>Synchronous attendance is required for this class, with points beginning starting in week 2. Attendance will take the form of answering questions on Poll Everywhere. The page for this class is at <a href="pollev.com/epstein">pollev.com/epstein</a>.</p>
   <p>Participation grade will be assessed by counting the number of responses submitted on-time, divided by the total number of questions. To account for help account for conflicts, etc. during the quarter, we will drop two classses from the participation grade (e.g., a student can miss two classes and still get full participation credit). Again, if you have an exceptional circumstance, please email the course staff. Given the drop policy, the most common case is that no additional action will be taken.</p>
   <h3>Re-grading</h3>
   <p>Regrades for assignments, exams, or participation can be submitted by emailing the course stuff up to 48 hours after a grade is posted. Regrade requests should articulate, in a paragraph or less, what points are being requested and why the grade should be higher according to the rubric. This could be that the grader mis-entered the grade, did not realize that a student's work matched the rubric, or that the student provided a correct response which was not on the rubric.</p>
   <p>Our experience is that about 10% of regrades result in a grade change and a lower percentage have any effect on overall grades. In a large class such as this one, regrade requests can create substantial additional work for the course staff. We are likely to delay responding to any regrade requests until the end of the quarter and may only address those which could impact a student's final grade.</p>
   <h2 id="resources">Online Resources and Collaboration</h2>
   <p>In general, the course staff expects that you will look at code and examples from many online resources as part of the assignments, particularly to resolve syntax and understand frameworks. We expect that you'll use other libraries you find, and will even require it in some assignments. These practices are often critical to the work of developers today. The best developers are adept at interpreting the examples they see, customizing them to their specific situation, and citing their sources so they can find them later. We expect you to do the same.</p>
   <p>While learning from examples is encouraged, attempting to pass existing writing or an example from the web as your own is not allowed. <strong>To be clear: looking at or submitting a student's assignment from a previous course offering is not allowed.</strong> If you ever have a question about what is or is not appropriate, feel free to ask the course staff!</p>
   <p>Talking to classmates about class material, assignment requirements, etc. is a great way to verify ideas and get feedback. But this distinctly does *not* permit attempting to pass off someone else's code as your own. Talking over ideas and approaches is allowed, but the work that you produce and submit must be your own.</p>
   <p>The CSE department at the University of Washington, where Professor Epstein completed his Ph.D., had the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilligan%27s_Island">Gilligan's Island rule</a>:</p>
   <blockquote>After discussing with someone, get rid of all written records of the collaboration (no whiteboards, email, paper, etc.) and then engage in a totally unrelated activity like watching Gilligan's Island before returning to the work.</blockquote>
   <p>In essence, feel free to talk to others, but take a break to ensure you've learned from the collaboration rather than copied. The reference is dated, swap it out for whatever Netflix show or other activity you're in to.</p>
   <h3 id="chatgpt">ChatGPT and other Generative AI Models</h3>
   <p><strong>Chatbots driven by Large Language Models are not allowed for any of the assessments in this course</strong>. Similarly, you cannot use Generative AI models for image/video creation like Dall-E. I believe that they could do a mediocre job at many of the assessments, and if strung together cleverly, you could probably pass the class by using them. But it goes without saying that using them would be giving up on opportunities for learning and critical thinking. Further, we expect that responses produced by such systems will be coherent, but will not resemble the depth of thought that we hope that students in this course aspire to.</p>
   <h2 id="integrity">Academic Integrity</h2>
   <p>Our hope is that you're taking this class because you're excited to think about social technology. Our job as the course staff is to help facilitate your learning. The assignments, exams, and participation requirements in this course are designed to help toward that learning. Naturally, there will be ways to shortcut this learning to arrive at a desirable solution with the least amount of effort. But by doing so, you're missing the opportunity to learn the topics.</p>
   <p>As discussed above, acknowledge your sources. Attempting to pass someone else's work off as your own is not allowed. If you do so, you will receive a failing grade for the assignment or the entire course at the instructor's discretion. The course staff will report the incident to UCI's Office of Academic Integrity &amp; Student Conduct. What will follow will be unpleasant, just don't do it.</p>
   <p>If you're having problems in this course, come talk to the course staff. The shortcut isn't worth it.</p>
   <p>For more info, take a look at <a href="https://aisc.uci.edu/students/academic-integrity/index.php">UCI's academic integrity policy</a> and <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism">ACM's</a>. Talk to the course staff if you have additional questions.</p>
   <h2>Accomodations</h2>
