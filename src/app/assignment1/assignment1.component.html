   <h1>Assignment 1: Making a Meme</h1>
   <h3>Due 11:59pm April 17, 2024</h3>
   <h2>Assignment Description</h2>
   <p>The first assignment is simple: make something that goes viral. In doing this, you'll have to grapple with the difficulties around making something that spreads online.</p>
   <p>You can create any kind of content that you want. A meme, a video, an essay, a piece of fan fiction, a photoshop, and much more would all suffice. The only requirement is that it needs to be spreadable online. You can use platforms such as YouTube, TikTok, Reddit, Medium, Twitter/Mastadon, or other blog or news outlets. You're also welcome to use platforms with more dedicated or niche interests that we'll talk about later in the quarter, like Strava or Venmo.</p>
   <p>You do not need to go viral across the whole internet, and can instead target a more focused community that you belong to. In your writeup, you'll be asked to explain to the course staff what that community is, and why what you created is designed to go viral in that community. For those of you who are not active on social media, you can join platforms like Reddit, TikTok, and Instagram without using your real identity.</p>
   <p>There's lots of guidance online on how to go viral: a quick <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=How+to+go+viral+online">Google Search</a> surfaces dozens of articles. One common trend is iteration: <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/Upworthy/how-to-make-that-one-thing-go-viral-just-kidding#25">Upworthy recommends trying out 25 versions of your main text or headline</a>. They point out that your first versions might be awkward or ridiculous, but if you push through that awkwardness you'll figure out better ways to phrase your idea.</p>
   <p>Iteration is a core goal of the assignment. Your first attempt might not gain much traction. Reflect on what's working and what's not, and try something else. You'll tell us about what you learned through this iteration process in your written reflection. Your grade won't get decreased if you iterate and nothing goes viral, but we will consider whether your meme is a fit for the communities where you post it, and whether it can reasonably spread there. For example, don't expect your meme sent to a WhatsApp group with just your parents and siblings to get much traction beyond that group. Though, that could be a good space for getting feedback.</p>
   <p>As you prepare your meme, be thoughtful in how you're going to measure its spread. Some platforms have easy-to-monitor and available mechanics such as likes, views, or replies. But you may have to use other mechanisms for measuring, such as <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1008015?hl=en">Google Analytics</a>, or circling back via word-of-mouth.</p>
   <h3>Ground rules</h3>
   <p>There are some ground rules for the assignment:</p>
   <ul>
      <li>No negativity: aim to create joy or fun, not pain. Use reasonable judgment as to what content is off-limits for a course. Examples of content that are off-limits include targeting groups that other community members belong to, personal attacks, libel, slander, harassment, pornography, and bullying. Check your idea with the course staff if you're not sure.</li>
      <li>No meta-memes about IN4MATX 153. This means no memes about the course, and specifically, memes of the effect: "my professor wants me to go viral, help me go viral."</li>
      <li>You must create the content that you're sharing, and not share someone else's content. However, you may remix someone else's content (with attribution/permission as appropriate) to create yours if desired. You're welcome to use online generative AI tools like ChatGPT, Dall-E, etc. to help create content, though you might have to be thoughtful about how you use that content to go viral. This might seem like a contradiction with the forbidding of ChatGPT described in the <a href="syllabus#chatgpt">syllabus</a>. But the key difference is that you're not being directly assessed on the quality of your meme, so you're welcome to use these AIs as tools for brainstorming or creating content.</li>
      <li>You must create new content for this class. You cannot reuse something that you previously created or shared.</li>
   </ul>
   <h3>Hints</h3>
   <p>A few hints around what's worked (and what has not) for students in the past:</p>
   <ul>
      <li>Be thoughtful about what platform you're sharing on. If you are posting on a UCI meme discord, for example, make sure itâ€™s relevant and particularly resonant for those at UCI. We expect that many of the most successful memes will be shared in non-UCI communities. Aim to create several pieces of content and iterate on failed viral attempts. You can even try similar things on different platforms; something could work well on TikTok but fall flat on Discord.</li>
      <li>Your writeup is primarily being evaluated on what you learned from the process, rather than whether the content you created went viral. The best write-ups therefore highlighted what was learned from that failure, and how you iterated to achieve greater success.</li>
      <li>Get creative, and consider doing something different than what your peers might think of. People are less likely to engage (upvote, re-share, etc.) with content that's similar to content they've seen before recently.</li>
   </ul>
   <h3>Common questions</h3>
   <p>A few common questions from other instances of this assignment:</p>
   <ul>
      <li><strong>Does it matter how viral my meme actually went?</strong> You're being graded on your reflections on your attempt to go viral, rather than the virality itself.</li>
      <li><strong>Can I buy likes?</strong> Don't do it. It's not helping with the learning goals of the assignment.</li>
      <li><strong>It's not fair, my friend knows an influencer!</strong> That's fine! You're not graded on actual popularity. Your friend will inevitably have a different reflection than yours, but that doesn't make your experience trying to go viral any less worthy.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Submission</h2>
   <p>You will submit a zipped folder with three files as part of this assignment. Submissions will be made to <a href="https://canvas.eee.uci.edu/courses/62680/assignments/1380613">Canvas</a>.</p>
   <h3>Submission format</h3>
   <p>Your zip should contain the following three files:</p>
   <ul>
      <li><code>meme.*</code>: the actual meme, in whatever form you would like it presented to your peers. We expect that most will be some form of image (<code>.jpeg</code> or <code>.png</code>), video (<code>.m4a</code> or <code>.mov</code>), but some might be documents or webpages (<code>.pdf</code> or <code>.html</code>. Make sure your submission crops out any evidence of how viral your content actually went (e.g., the number of retweets), to avoid that information influencing the crowdsourced voting.</li>
      <li><code>alttext.txt</code>, with alt text for your meme. Alt text is typically a few sentences, describing your meme to a visually impaired user. This <a href="https://veroniiiica.com/how-to-write-alt-text-for-memes/">blog post</a> might be helpful in crafting alt text specifically for memes.</li>
      <li><code>reflection.pdf</code>: a reflection (max 600 words) on your attempts to go viral, described below.</li>
   </ul>
   <h3>Reflecting on your attempts</h3>
   <p>In your reflection, include:</p>
   <ol>
      <li>A copy of your meme and its alt text, or link to a publicly-accessible version of it (e.g., a public tweet or video). Include where it was shared, if it's not obvious (e.g., a link to YouTube.com). This is duplicated from the <code>meme.*</code> file, for ease of grading.</li>
      <li>Your evidence of virality such as view count, likes, geographic spread, or another measure(s).</li>
      <li>A reflection (max 600 words) on your experiences trying to go viral, including what you learned from iteration. Your reflection should first summarize how you made decisions about what to share. Why that platform or medium? What is the larger context, such as current events or online subcultures, that impacted the content you created? Who was the intended audience? Then, aim to discuss what happened when you shared the content. If it went viral, why? If everything you tried failed to go viral, why? Do you think you would get the same outcome in another parallel world, or not? This analysis is important: even if you're not active on social media, you can still analyze your design and performance. Consider reflecting on your meme relative to topics discussed in class.</li>
   </ol>
   <h2>Rating the memes!</h2>
   <p>Virality isn't a deterministic indicator of content quality. So, we'll let you vote on the best memes from the class! After the assignment deadline, the course staff will open up a website to allow you to rate each other's content through an A-B comparison process. Instructions will be emailed.</p>
   <p>We expect everyone to participate in this rating process. If you do not participate, <strong>your grade on this assignment will be deducted 10%</strong>.</p>
   <h2>Grading</h2>
   <p>Your grade will be broken down as follows, with description of what is required for the maximum score (mastery) in each category:</p>
   <ul>
      <li><strong>Meme submission (3 points):</strong> Meme is new content created for the course, includes alt text, and is submitted in a form suitable for rating.</li>
      <li><strong>Execution (6 points):</strong> Meme has a clear message communicated in a creative and effective way, with an audience which might care about that content. Meme went viral, or demonstrated repeated iterations with learning and improvement.</li>
      <li><strong>Reflection (6 points):</strong> Reflection deeply considers why the content was successful or not, integrating concepts discussed in lecture.</li>
   </ul>
   <h3>Extra credit</h3>
   <p>10% extra credit on this assignment will be given to a small number of submissions (up to 5) that the staff deems went most viral, and a small number of submissions (up to 5) that win the class vote.</p>
